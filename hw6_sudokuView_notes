Homework 6: Sudoku View
Level: Minimal

I have been stumped on this entire section of the program. It's a compound
stump. 1st part is that I made some poor design choices on the SudokuBoard 
part of the assignment. Second part was my failure to grasp Graphics/drawing
concepts. I understand it better now, but my board design doesn't pair nicely
with my needs for this portion of the assignment. 

For the graphics in the cells, I'm going with an LCD digit display, like a 
digital clock. I set up all the LCD bars as lines, and will have all cells 
contain the base shapes, and changing the color of each segment as needed for 
the different values 1-12. 

Before next weeks assignment, I will have to do a bottom up SudokuBoard
rewrite to make the visuals work together.
