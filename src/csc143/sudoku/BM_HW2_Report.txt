Homework 2: SudokuBoard
Level : Minimal

Report:
Unfortunately the clock ran out on me this week leaving some of the issues 
incomplete.

My attack plan for this project was to use the SudokuBoard class as a base and 
nest an array of regions (custom JPanel subclass), implemented as an inner 
class. The Regions class would then contain an array of cells (another custom 
JPanel subclass), all numbered in region/ordinal format. 

From there, I would implement the SelectedCell interface in the main 
SudokoBoard Class. 

My idea for the Coordinate transform was to implement it in the Cell class, so 
each cell would contain its own XY and Reg/Ord coordinates as individual 
values. 

I still have several unresolved requirements including:
	Spacing of the outer border not aligning with cells.
	The SelectCell interface implementation.
	Row/Col to Reg/Ord switch.
	 
	
	My solution for the first two problems called for the XY coordinates and I 
	was not able to figure out the right algorithm to convert them. 
 	 
 Having hacked away it frantically for the last 36 hours, I'm not very 
 confident in my design decision. All of my code ended up as a complex chain 
 that didn't lend itself to easy changes without breaking everything down the 
 line. 
 
 As a fix, I feel I need a total re-write, and should start with a Row/Col 
 number base for my cells. As I got more frustrated with it towards the end, I 
 resorted to some trial and error testing which left my classes a little 
 cluttered with unnecessary, redundant fields. 
 
 Bugs found and fixed along the way. 
 	I found a particularly frustrating bug in alternating the region colors. 
 	Boards with even numbered columns needed separate color swapping logic
 	than the odd-numbered column boards. The nature of the region arrangement 
 	as Col x Row vs the cell arrangement of Row x Col complicated this issue, 
 	but I was able to find a fix by sketching out the patterns visually.
